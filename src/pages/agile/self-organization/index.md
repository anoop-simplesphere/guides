Defining self-organizing teams

A group of motivated individuals, who work together toward a goal, have the ability and authority to take decisions and readily adapt to changing demands. Let's look at some important ingredients of a self-organizing team:

* They pull work for themselves and don't wait for their leader to assign work. This ensures a greater sense of ownership and commitment.
* They manage their work (allocation, reallocation, estimation, reestimation, delivery, and rework) as a group.
* They still require mentoring and coaching, but they don't require "command and control."
* They communicate more with each other, and their commitments are more often to project teams than to the ScrumMaster.
* They understand requirements and aren't afraid to ask questions to get their doubts clarified.
* They continuously enhance their own skills and recommend innovative ideas and improvements.

Five essentials of self-organizing teams

* Competency: Individuals need to be competent for the job at hand. This will result in confidence in their work and will eliminate the need for direction from above.
* Collaboration: They should work as a team rather than as a group of individuals. Teamwork is encouraged.
* Motivation: Team motivation is the key to success. Team members should be focused and interested in their work.
* Trust and respect: Team members trust and respect each other. They believe in collective code ownership and are ready to go the extra mile to help each other resolve issues.
* Continuity: The team should be together for a reasonable duration; changing its composition every now and then doesn't help. Continuity is essential for the team.
